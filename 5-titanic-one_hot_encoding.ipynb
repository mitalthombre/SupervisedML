By not using the categorical features, we were missing out on a lot of potentially important information.\n","\n","As we will see, converting categorical features to numerical (so that they can be \"digested\" by the Scikit-Learn transformers and models) adds a bit of complexity to the modelling pipeline. This is why in this notebook we will start by encoding them without using pipelines (just to understand what's going) and only later we will include categorical encoding inside the pipeline.\n","\n","Before going through this notebook, read the Platform lesson on One-Hot Encoding: https://platform.wbscodingschool.com/courses/data-science/12675/ "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"moO1BcHuXmR0"},"source":["## 1.
